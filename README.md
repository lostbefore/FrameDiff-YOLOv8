# FrameDiff-YOLOv8
A hybrid object detection framework that integrates frame difference methods with YOLOv8 to improve the detection of small, fast-moving objects like falling debris from high altitudes. This repository aims to explore and enhance the performance of motion-based object detection in dynamic video environments.
